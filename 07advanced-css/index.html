        Neither do we, especially after the pandemic, which paralyzed the creative economy. Everyone inside its value chain was affected, from creation and production to distribution. This crisis exposed and revealed pre-existing vulnerabilities within the culture sector. Many creatives and cultural professionals were denied the economic assistance given to workers from other sectors. Even though we consumed more online content than ever, creators barely received fair remuneration.

        <h2>Why do we <a href="https://www.famsf.org/stories/6-reasons-to-sketch" target="_blank">Draw</a>?</h2>
            <p>A sketching habit strengthens fine motor skills and hand-eye coordination. New pathways form and, according to studies, increase blood flow to the reward center in your brain. You are training your eyes to deliver visual information to your brain, which, in turn, communicates with your hand. Because observational drawing requires logic and creativity, both the right and left sides of your brain are activated. Increased motor skills and coordination lead to many other mental and physical benefits, including recall and agility.</p>

            <p>Art is an important part of life, as it helps us to explore our creativity and express ourselves in unique ways. Art is more than just a form of expression - it’s a way of understanding the world and our place in it. In this blog post, we’ll discuss the psychological, social, and cognitive benefits of creating art and how it can bring joy and purpose to our lives.</p>
