        <h1>Paintings</h1>
        <p>When someone hears the word "<em>Painting</em>" most people think the basic idea of dipping a paint brush in a jar of paint to make shapes to form a picture. Painting is the medium that uses pigment to create lights and shadows by using colors. This is usually a trickier medium for some because it requires a lot of time and patience. However, some find it very relaxing as it causes you to slow down and think about positive and negative space to create an image.</p>

        <h2>Watercolor Paintings Examples</h2>
        <p>Some people prefer watercolor paintings because it's not as stressfull as oil or acrylic paint is. Given the name "watercolor," it's clear to see how the technique and paint get their name. Watercolor paints cause the pigment in the paint to spreed freely when water touches it. The more water you add, less of pigment you'll get.</p>
